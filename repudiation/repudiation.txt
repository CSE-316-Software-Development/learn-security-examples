- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The vulnerability in insecure.js leads to a lack of non-repudiation because it doesn't track user details in actions, making it impossible to determine the user responsible for an action. The secure.js addresses this by incorporating a middleware to log incoming request details and including user information in the log streams, thus resolving the issue.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

To prevent tampering with the log file, we can implement authentication mechanisms. Additionally, maintaining multiple copies of the log file can enhance security and ensure the integrity of the logged data.
