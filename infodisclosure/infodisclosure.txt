Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?

In the insecure script, the absence of username sanitization poses a risk of injection attacks. For instance, a user could input a query like username!='', potentially retrieving information for all users. To mitigate this vulnerability, the secure.js script implements sanitization on the username received from the client, thus preventing injection attacks.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
1. Eliminate the console logs that contain sensitive information.
2. Integrate an authentication mechanism for enhanced security.
3. Encrypt the payload before transmitting information.
